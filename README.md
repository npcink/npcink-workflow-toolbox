# Npcink Workflow Toolbox

Single-image recovery remains attachment-scoped. Media Library attachment details and row actions can reopen the existing workbench, which reads available backups through `GET /wp-json/npcink-toolbox/v1/strong-local-confirmation/media-derivative-backups/{attachment_id}` before the administrator explicitly confirms restoration. This lookup does not restore, delete, or modify media.

Npcink Workflow Toolbox turns proven AI-assisted WordPress operations into
fixed, review-only buttons for site operators, including Cloud-managed web
search, Cloud-managed image-source candidates, Cloud-managed site knowledge,
and governed handoff flows. The WordPress.org release slug is
`npcink-workflow-toolbox`. The first-version runtime contracts keep the
existing `npcink-toolbox` REST namespace, ability ids, option names, and hook
names for compatibility with Core, Adapter, Cloud, and existing site
integrations.

It is intentionally separate from:

- `npcink-governance-core`, which owns governance, proposal records, approval, and audit;
- `npcink-abilities-toolkit`, which owns reusable WordPress Abilities API contracts;
- provider connector plugins, which can later own richer key management,
  provider selection, quota, and request logs.

## First Version

The first version provides:

- the sole top-level **Npcink AI** navigation shell and suite Overview, plus the
  Toolbox product page at **Npcink AI -> Toolbox**. Independently installed
  Npcink plugins keep their own WordPress Settings or Tools fallback and attach
  to this shell only while Toolbox is active. The Toolbox product Overview
  includes a read-only **Npcink capability health**
  summary for local workflow readiness and route-only compatibility; it is not
  a generic Abilities Explorer, provider picker, request log, or connector
  approval surface;
- a post editor **Npcink Content Support** sidebar whose default buttons focus
  on Npcink review and handoff flows: URL/manual/mixed article writing pack,
  confirmed plain-text draft preview, one explicit Core proposal handoff for a
  new WordPress `draft`, and optional empty-body-only Gutenberg loading that
  remains unsaved until the author's native WordPress action,
  publish preflight, direct existing-category and existing-tag suggestions,
  internal-link candidates, current-article contextual ALT review, and image
  candidates.
  Article narration and audio summary remain callable compatibility flows but
  are temporarily hidden from the default menu. Generic title, summary,
  broader taxonomy workflow, outline, and
  article-checkup support remains available through compatible route/rendering paths, plus
  selected-paragraph toolbar checks that do not replace body text;
- the operator-facing **Draft from source materials** entry stays compact in
  the sidebar and opens one three-step work modal: provide a URL or brief,
  confirm the writing direction, then review the draft. Source previews,
  related-site evidence, runtime detail, fact risk, and rights detail stay under
  compact lists or explicit disclosure.
  Metadata/navigation-only extraction stops before planning; optional
  empty-editor loading remains a separate reviewed action;
- a frontend article audio playback entry that renders only already adopted
  WordPress audio metadata near single posts; Cloud generation remains a
  candidate artifact path, and Toolbox may prepare a Core-governed article
  audio adoption plan with lightweight source-content freshness evidence, but
  does not adopt, import, regenerate, or write audio itself;
- a route-only content opportunity helper intent that samples recent, older,
  missing-image, and taxonomy-backed public content for bounded update,
  linking, expansion, or image opportunities; operator-facing site opportunity
  review lives in **Site Check**; media
  ALT/caption helper contracts stay available for editor-sidebar use and future
  batch review sets, but the standalone admin tool is not exposed;
- a **temporarily hidden Site Check compatibility panel** that retains the fixed-button toolbox's
  read-only decision router. It builds a local
  `site_ops_insight_pack.v1` from bounded public content, approved comment
  signals, media metadata, taxonomy summaries, Site Context readiness, and
  Cloud availability into a ranked review list for manual review, existing
  Toolbox fixed workflows, or optional Cloud detail. Supporting coverage metrics,
  charts, dimension views, findings, and evidence stay secondary. The local
  check runs without Cloud calls, Core proposals, persistence, or WordPress writes, and prepares a copyable
  `site_ops_cloud_analysis_request.v1` contract. When Cloud is connected and
  the administrator explicitly clicks **Use Cloud detail**, Toolbox may send
  that request to Cloud runtime for a suggestion-only
  `site_ops_cloud_analysis_result.v1`, without local queues, local run tables,
  Core proposal creation, or WordPress writes;
- a **Site Check** tab with two internal sections: **Current Check** for the
  ordinary manual site report, and **Scheduled Review** for low-frequency
  scheduled-review preview, optional local fallback settings, and a link to
  Cloud-owned run recovery. The former Advanced and Morning Brief entries
  remain only as compatibility routes into Site Check. Cloud run status, result
  reads, and recovery live in the Cloud Addon Runtime Runs tab. The
  scheduled-review preview reads bounded local public-content evidence and
  renders a dry-run Nightly Site Inspection preview without cron, Cloud calls,
  Core proposals, persistence, or WordPress writes. **Site Check** remains a
  manual site-check report for future reassessment, but not a default operator
  entry;
- no local Cloud Checks or Troubleshooting Checks panel. Cloud connection,
  hosted runtime, search, image-source, quota, entitlement, and service health
  diagnostics belong in `npcink-cloud-addon` or Cloud service-plane surfaces;
- a disabled-by-default **Local Fallback Preview (optional)** WP-Cron setting,
  folded behind the Scheduled Review advanced disclosure, that can overwrite
  one latest dry-run scheduled-review preview for operator review when Cloud is
  unavailable or during trials. It is not the Cloud scheduled inspection and it
  runs without Cloud calls, Core proposals, Action Scheduler, custom tables,
  leases, retries, dead letters, or WordPress content writes;
- Cloud-managed web search status, plus read-only Cloud-managed image-source
  and vector availability;
- an operator-filled content discoverability context for SEO, AEO, and GEO
  guidance that can be exposed to third-party AI callers;
- REST endpoints for image-source candidates, site knowledge/search, content
  discoverability, article-support fallback flows, media briefs, and media
  derivative handoffs;
- WordPress Abilities API registrations for the same tool actions;
- static tests and PHP syntax linting.

## Boundary

Toolbox primarily returns suggestions and planning artifacts. Two bounded local
write decisions are documented: the historical
`/local-admin-consent/featured-image` existing-attachment proof, and ADR-010's
`/strong-local-confirmation/image-adoption` lane for one present editor, one
fully previewed image, and one current article. The latter may import one
external or AI-generated image and optionally set it as featured, with native
capability checks, safe external download or verified Cloud artifact delivery,
and compensation rollback. ADR-011 separately allows one present administrator
to replace one existing Media Library image after exact same-origin preview
verification, explicit final confirmation, and Toolkit-owned backup/rollback.
Batch, background, external-Agent, publishing, taxonomy, settings, and
unrelated metadata writes continue through their governed paths.

ADR-006 distinguishes a non-Toolbox write path: an author-reviewed value may be
placed into the current article's visible, editable editor state and persisted
solely by native WordPress Publish or Update. That `native_editor_commit` path
creates no Core record because Toolbox performs no backend write. Media,
cross-object, global, external, background, hidden post-save, and governed batch
actions remain governed. ADR-014 defines a narrow current-article multi-link
transaction that stays in visible editor state and does not become governed
solely because several reviewed links are selected. The removed proposal-intent
bridge and current acceptance rules are recorded in the
[Editor Native Commit Migration Specification](docs/editor-native-commit-migration-spec.md).

The default product posture is content support outside the article body:
taxonomy/tag candidates, internal-link candidates, image candidates,
SEO/AEO/GEO suggestions, media metadata plans, duplicate-risk checks, and
publish-readiness checks. Human editors own the article text. Article
Assistant exists only as a fallback workbench for reviewed local draft
artifacts.

for all twelve committed buttons; partial parity is reported
rather than hidden. New default editor flows must add their own contract row.

## REST Routes

All routes require a logged-in user with `manage_options`. This list is a
compatibility allowlist, not an ownership claim: routes marked in the boundary
docs as Cloud-owned bridges, legacy compatibility seams, or explicit boundary
exceptions must keep those limits even though their first-version paths remain
registered.

- `POST /wp-json/npcink-toolbox/v1/nightly-inspection/cloud-batch/{run_id}/retry`

High-risk entries are intentionally constrained:

- `/ai/image-generation` is a legacy-compatible hosted image candidate seam.
  It accepts a reviewed prompt and returns image candidates only; Cloud owns
  generation runtime, model routing, prompt/runtime management, billing, quota,
  provider execution, and durable provider credentials. It does not import
  media, set featured images, or write WordPress data.
- `/site-knowledge/sync` is an explicit Cloud Site Knowledge manifest handoff.
  The only allowed first-version mode is a bounded refresh/manifest transport
  to Cloud. It must not add rebuild/delete modes, local indexing queues,
  stale-index policy, embedding configuration, vector database endpoints, or
  vector collection lifecycle ownership.
- `/site-media/index-batch` is an explicit operator-triggered projection
  refresh. Toolkit owns local attachment enumeration and revision evidence;
  Cloud owns vision and vector execution. Toolbox first reuses a matching
  Cloud Site Knowledge visual-evidence projection; only misses use the existing
  short-lived Cloud Addon Artifact upload and visual-recognition contract.
  One byte-stable image fingerprint therefore supports both ALT review and
  semantic media retrieval, while metadata-only changes re-embed without
  rerunning vision. The route does not change attachment metadata, import
  WordPress media, keep a second cache, delete files, or write post content.
- `/local-admin-consent/featured-image` remains the historical ADR-003 direct
  write proof for one existing attachment with Core-owned audit.
- `/strong-local-confirmation/image-adoption` is the ADR-010 editor-present
  lane. It accepts only `import_only`, `set_featured_existing`, or
  `import_and_set_featured` for one current article and one fully reviewed
  image. It uses `edit_post`, `upload_files` when importing, safe HTTPS download
  checks, MIME/dimension limits, and compensation rollback. It is not available
  to background, Cloud callback, Adapter, Agent, batch, or publishing flows.
- Nightly Inspection Cloud Batch routes are compatibility bridges to
  Cloud-owned runtime runs. Toolbox must not store server-side run history,
  own retry policy, expose a recovery workspace, schedule work, create Core
  proposals, or write WordPress data.
- `/flows/article-assistant` is route-only compatibility and must stay hidden
  from the default operator UI. Normal editorial work belongs in the editor
  content-support sidebar or reviewed Core handoff flows.

`/flows/article-brief` remains an API composition primitive for OpenClaw and
external AI callers; it is not exposed as a current operator-facing admin tool.

The status route distinguishes registered Toolbox surfaces from currently
available Cloud execution. Cloud-backed actions report `registered`,
`cloud_required`, `available`, and `unavailable_reason` fields so standalone
Toolbox installs do not imply that Cloud-managed search, image-source, Site
Knowledge, or hosted GPT actions can run without a connected Cloud Addon or
host-provided runtime filter.

Toolbox admin result panels can render governed `operator_feedback` payloads
from Adapter/Core handoff failures. The feedback is for operator revision only;
Toolbox may submit one Core media optimization proposal from the Adapter media
derivative recipe after reviewed metadata and derivative artifact evidence are
present, but it does not approve proposals, execute proposals, or perform
WordPress writes.
The fixed media optimization flow is: select or resolve an existing attachment,
generate a short-lived Cloud preview, review the derivative and adoption
preflight, then submit one Core optimization review. Attachment adoption,
content URL repair, and settings URL repair remain separate governed actions so
hard-coded post URLs and URLs stored in theme or plugin options are not silently
rewritten by preview generation.
Batch media optimization uses bounded review sets: build a review plan,
generate previews for selected candidates, and submit only selected Core
reviews. It is intentionally not presented as one-click whole-site replacement.
Toolbox also bundles `modules/local-automation-runtime/` as an isolated
exception record for the future `npcink-local-automation-runtime` owner. That
module supports Phase 1A Manual Read-Only Preview for Morning Brief evidence,
validates dry-run replay fixtures, and contains the Phase 2 Basic WP-Cron
Dry-Run Local Fallback Preview proof. Phase 1A is a Toolbox-hosted operator
preview, not a runtime execution phase; that manual path does not register
hooks, create runtime job tables, schedule workers, acquire leases, retry
actions, dead-letter failures, persist preview results, approve proposals,
execute Adapter actions, or write WordPress data. Phase 2 Basic WP-Cron
Dry-Run is an accepted boundary exception only; it may register one
disabled-by-default WP-Cron hook that overwrites a single latest-preview option.
It must not become workflow runtime lifecycle ownership, scheduler truth, queue
ownership, retry policy, lease storage, run recovery, Cloud scheduled
inspection, or a Pro scheduler, and it must not call Cloud, create Core
proposals, use Action Scheduler, create custom tables, acquire leases, retry
actions, process dead letters, or write WordPress content. Current Pro planning
does not introduce plugin-side Action Scheduler; Pro batch processing should
use Cloud Batch Runtime, with the plugin
limited to read-only entitlement detail, batch intent, status/result sync, and
reviewed Core proposal handoff.
The runtime module remains bundled with Toolbox for release. It should become a
separate plugin only after a new ADR proves independent lifecycle needs, real
runtime state, a stable cross-plugin API, explicit data migration/uninstall
ownership, and graceful Toolbox degradation when the runtime plugin is inactive.
The product posture is Cloud-first, not cloud-only: Pro Cloud Batch Runtime is
the primary commercial path for reliable scoring, entitlement, usage metering,
queue-backed execution, retry, observability, and result retention, while the
local WP-Cron path remains a WordPress-side fallback preview and onboarding aid,
not a second Pro scheduler.
Cloud Addon Runtime Runs can read recent/status/result detail and request
Cloud-owned retry for known Nightly Inspection runs. Toolbox may retain
compatibility REST bridges for existing callers, but runtime entitlement,
quota, batch limit, retention, recent/status/result, and retry detail belong in
Cloud Addon Runtime Runs. The visible Site Check tab links to Cloud Addon for
run recovery instead of presenting a second run-recovery workspace. Any local
display of `pro_cloud_runtime` detail is not billing truth.
Action Scheduler is reserved as a future local fallback/substrate candidate only
if a confirmed local-batch requirement justifies the added plugin complexity.
ADR-005 freezes this current split: WP-Cron is the local fallback preview or
future bounded local submit trigger, Cloud Batch Runtime is the Pro execution
path, and neither Toolbox nor Cloud becomes a second WordPress scheduler or
write owner.
The Site Knowledge review plan route builds a blocked Core handoff plan from
Cloud evidence only; it does not approve, preflight, or execute that plan.

## Abilities

Toolbox abilities are server-side tool wrappers. External AI callers provide
task input and receive normalized suggestion payloads; they do not receive
provider API keys or direct provider credentials.

General AI composition guidance is kept in
[AI Content Composition Abilities](docs/ai-content-composition-abilities.md).

When the WordPress Abilities API is available, Toolbox registers compatibility
wrapper ids. These ids do not grant Toolbox ownership of Cloud runtime,
provider secrets, content indexing lifecycle, or final WordPress write
authorization:

- `npcink-toolbox/search-image-source`
- `npcink-toolbox/generate-image`
- `npcink-toolbox/search-site-knowledge`
- `npcink-toolbox/cloud-web-search`
- `npcink-toolbox/get-site-knowledge-status`
- `npcink-toolbox/request-site-knowledge-sync`
- `npcink-toolbox/build-article-write-plan`
- `npcink-toolbox/build-article-batch-write-plan`
- `npcink-toolbox/build-article-media-batch-write-plan`
- `npcink-toolbox/build-site-knowledge-review-plan`
- `npcink-toolbox/build-nightly-inspection-review-plan`
- `npcink-toolbox/build-media-derivative-handoff`
- `npcink-toolbox/get-content-discoverability-context`
- `npcink-toolbox/validate-content-discoverability-context`
- `npcink-toolbox/build-content-discoverability-brief`
- `npcink-toolbox/build-ai-article-writing-pack`

The legacy `/vector-search`, `/flows/article-brief`, `/flows/article-assistant`,
and `/flows/media-brief` REST routes remain compatibility surfaces, but they are
no longer registered as public Toolbox abilities. New AI callers should use
`npcink-toolbox/search-site-knowledge`, `npcink-toolbox/build-article-write-plan`,
content-support routes, or editor/media-specific routes instead of those legacy
ability ids.

When `npcink-abilities-toolkit` is active, Toolbox uses its public registration
helpers so the tools can be discovered by existing Npcink consumers.
Toolbox ability ids stay under `npcink-toolbox/*` so they do not collide with
Core governance abilities or first-party WordPress abilities.

Ability metadata includes Toolbox scopes such as `cap.toolbox.image_source`,
`cap.toolbox.vector_search`, and `cap.toolbox.workflow_suggest`. Content context uses
`cap.toolbox.context.read`. The first admin REST surface remains
`manage_options` gated; external AI/app-key authorization should be enforced by
Core or the host that consumes the ability scope metadata. First-version host
integration hooks are `npcink_toolbox_rest_permission` and
`npcink_toolbox_ability_permission`.

## Content Discoverability Context

The admin page defaults to a Start surface that summarizes Cloud runtime,
Site Context, Site Knowledge, and final-write posture before sending operators
to the right work surface. Its Site Context form stores operator-maintained SEO, AEO,
and GEO guidance: site positioning, target audience, brand voice, keywords,
allowed and forbidden claims, exception rules, SEO/AEO/GEO rules, and proposal
fields AI may suggest. It is stored in `npcink_toolbox_content_context`,
which must not contain provider keys, private credentials, request logs, quota
state, billing records, or write authorization. Provider keys and routing
belong in Cloud/Addons or dedicated connector owners, not in Site Context.

The context is exposed only as read-only, suggestion-only guidance through
`npcink-toolbox/get-content-discoverability-context`. Third-party AI callers
may also call `npcink-toolbox/validate-content-discoverability-context` to
check filling quality and `npcink-toolbox/build-content-discoverability-brief`
to get the primary lightweight content-support contract: SEO/AEO/GEO guidance,
taxonomy/tag candidates, internal-link hints, proposal fields, and conservative
candidates from supplied post or topic input. Final WordPress writes still
require Core proposal approval.

For natural-language article requests from OpenClaw or another external AI,
`npcink-toolbox/build-ai-article-writing-pack` composes the context,
validation result, discoverability brief, writing instructions, and guardrails
into one suggestion-only pack. It is a convenience fallback for broad prompts,
not the default SEO/AEO/GEO, taxonomy, link, image, or publish-readiness
surface.

The legacy Article Assistant REST flow can still compose one local
`article_draft_v1` workbench artifact from topic, evidence candidates,
image-source candidates, site context, operator notes, and an optional reviewed
draft. It is route-only compatibility, not an operator-facing tool and not a
public Toolbox ability. Reviewed draft write-plan handoffs should use
`npcink-toolbox/build-article-write-plan` through REST or Abilities; normal
editorial work should stay in the editor content-support sidebar.

Toolbox fixed buttons are the operator-click surface for repeatable OpenClaw
flows. They should reuse the same ability ids, plan artifact shapes, Adapter
recipe guidance, and Core proposal handoff as OpenClaw natural-language flows.
Toolbox must not turn those buttons into a separate approval store, media
registry, workflow runtime, prompt/model control plane, or WordPress write
executor.
Batch replacement must be developed and accepted first as an OpenClaw/Adapter
contract with Core approval, commit preflight, execution profile evidence,
per-action results, and Abilities media replacement callbacks. Toolbox then
exposes that accepted path as the fixed `media_optimization_v1` best-practice
button; it must not create a separate batch writer.

The article plan flow and `npcink-toolbox/build-article-write-plan` ability
assemble a Core-ready `article_write_plan` for a reviewed draft. They do not
call Core, approve proposals, publish content, or write WordPress data.
After a user rates an editor draft preview `usable`, a separate explicit button
may submit that plan through Adapter to Core and then stops at the proposal
receipt. Core approval and Adapter/Toolkit execution create only a WordPress
`draft`; an author or editor publishes it later through native WordPress.
The **Site Check** surface is the operator-facing path for site content
opportunity triage. The bounded content snapshot helper remains available through
`/ai/site-helpers` for route/internal composition, while the reviewed-draft
write-plan route and Ability stay
available for machine clients, future Cloud bulk import, and explicit API
composition, but they are not exposed as a backend operator tool while there is
no active external-draft import workflow.

The post editor also exposes **Npcink Content Support** as a plugin sidebar
opened from the editor top toolbar. Its visible buttons run fixed Npcink flows
for publish preflight, internal-link candidates, and image-source candidates
from the current draft context. Article narration and audio summary remain
callable but are temporarily hidden from the default menu. Generic title,
summary, category, tag, outline, article-checkup, discoverability,
current-article ALT, and comment-reply support remains available through
compatible REST/result-rendering paths, but those entries are not default
buttons when a generic AI plugin already owns similar experiments. Related
existing-post review is handled through publish preflight duplicate-risk checks
and Toolkit-backed internal-link candidates rather than a separate visible
button. The route-only article checkup remains a local full-draft diagnostic
surface for sentence density, fact-gap, tone, and structure review; it points to
paragraphs and editing direction, but does not rewrite, insert, or replace
article text. When a generic AI plugin shows output in the editor and the author
chooses to insert, save, or publish through the normal editor flow, that visible
editor action is the human review step and should not be routed through Npcink
Core approval. Toolbox follows the Core AI write classification matrix for the
remaining local consent, strong confirmation, and Core proposal cases. The sidebar
also prefetches a local-only progressive recommendation
set after the editor opens or the draft stabilizes: existing taxonomy matches,
recent media-library candidates, and local preflight checks are shown quickly,
while Cloud title/summary generation, image-source search, hosted image
candidate requests, deep search, and proposal handoffs remain explicit
follow-up actions. The metadata buttons use
lighter draft/taxonomy fast paths and merge their results into one
`article_discoverability_optimization.v1` review surface. The full
`summary_terms_optimization` intent remains available as a compatibility and
diagnostic path when hosted AI, related Site Knowledge, discoverability
evidence, ranking, dedupe, and review metrics are needed together. The same
result shape includes a `content_metadata_delta` P0 artifact with an issue
record, diagnosis, excerpt and existing-term delta, authorization
classification, outcome checks, and learning candidates for later review.
Operators can scope the run to the full article, selected text or block, or a
topic-only brief. Existing WordPress term recommendations remain suggestion
only. Proposed new terms are shown as review-only vocabulary gaps and include a
preview-only Core handoff packet for accepted summary and term choices.
Internal-link results are returned as `internal_link_candidates.v1` candidates
with suggested anchor text, placement hints, and source evidence, but link
insertion stays a human editor action. Publish preflight now returns a unified
`pre_publish_review.v1` panel that points the operator back to summary,
category, tag, internal-link, image, duplicate-risk, and SEO handoff checks.
SEO metadata is prepared as a single-post `seo_meta_handoff_preview.v1`
payload and can be submitted through Adapter as one Core proposal. Toolbox
stops after showing the proposal receipt and Governance Core link; it does not
approve, execute, mutate SEO fields, or retry failures.
See [Editor Progressive Recommendations Closeout](docs/archive/2026-06/editor-progressive-recommendations-closeout.md)
for the local prefetch contract, quality rules, and verification record.
Current-article image ALT/caption review belongs in the editor sidebar, where
the post context and used images are available. The backend Image Handling tab
only exposes a selected media-library review set for recent images with weak
ALT or caption metadata. For missing ALT only, each visually confirmed row can
build `npcink-abilities-toolkit/build-media-alt-apply-plan` through Adapter and
submit the returned `media_alt_apply_plan.v1` to Core `/proposals/from-plan`.
Toolbox stops after proposal creation and does not request
`approve-and-execute`, poll, or treat candidate quality signals as
authorization. The ALT/caption review flow performs no WordPress media import,
media metadata write, approval, execution, or audit ownership. ADR-010
separately permits one fully reviewed image adoption for the current article;
it does not authorize ALT/caption batch writes. A visual-evidence miss may use
the existing short-lived Cloud Addon Artifact transport; matching Site
Knowledge evidence is reused first, including by media search indexing. The
legacy
`/flows/media-alt-caption-review-plan` remains a local diagnostic preview and
is not sent to Core. For current
article `core/image` occurrences only, the editor may automatically apply
missing ALT directly to the in-memory Gutenberg draft. This Native Commit path
creates no proposal or Core audit and still requires the operator to use
WordPress Save draft or Update for persistence. Context remains
the primary ALT source. Only missing ALT with no useful nearby heading,
paragraph, or caption may silently reuse the existing Cloud Addon
`image_context_evidence.v1` runtime as a visual-fact fallback; failure is
non-blocking, existing ALT is preserved, and no extra confirmation UI is added.
ALT/caption candidates reject runtime provenance text such as model/provider
names, prompt labels, and "Generated by" descriptions before review and again
before governed handoff. Caption edits are excluded from the ALT apply contract
and remain manual review work until Core exposes a separate policy.
Accepted excerpt, existing category, and existing tag choices can be
converted into a dry-run `content_metadata_apply_plan` through
`/wp-json/npcink-toolbox/v1/flows/content-metadata-apply-plan`; the plan uses
`npcink-abilities-toolkit/build-content-metadata-apply-plan` as its Core
handoff ability so third-party plugins do not need to depend on Toolbox. Core still owns proposal
approval and final execution remains outside Toolbox. Existing category/tag
candidates are ranked by `npcink-abilities-toolkit/suggest-post-taxonomy-terms`
and the reusable `taxonomy_tag_review_set.v1` packet is built by
`npcink-abilities-toolkit/build-taxonomy-tag-review-set` when available, then
presented by Toolbox for review. That packet exposes proposal-ready action
labels: Generate and apply summary, Recommend and apply tags, Recommend
categories. Summary application and existing
tag assignment can request Core auto-approval when policy allows; category
changes stay recommendation-first by default, and new tag creation remains
deferred to a later taxonomy governance workflow. The panel returns suggestions
only; it does not
insert links, assign terms, create terms, update excerpts or SEO fields, import
media, publish content, store acceptance/audit truth, or write WordPress data.
Do not expand Local Admin Consent to this metadata flow. A future single-post
metadata direct-apply proof would first need a separate
`strong_local_confirmation` UX and audit contract covering exact final values,
old/new metadata, actor and source evidence, confirmation copy, recovery
evidence, and fail-closed audit behavior. Until then, accepted metadata choices
remain Core proposal handoffs.
The image-source button opens a Cloud image recommendation modal: it
automatically searches from the selected paragraph or selected block when
available, combines that with the current draft context, and also lets the
editor enter a manual query. The same modal includes a secondary image-plan
action that runs the existing media brief flow from the saved current post, so
the plan feeds later source search, AI generation, and media SEO review without
becoming a separate sidebar entry. Toolbox sends a bounded visual context
request so Cloud may build a visual brief, use site context vectors managed by
Cloud for reranking, and return media SEO suggestions; these are runtime
details, not local vector/index or provider ownership. Returned images remain
`image_candidate.v1` suggestions with provider, attribution, source,
license-review, and Unsplash download tracking metadata preserved. Editor review
projection may use
`npcink-abilities-toolkit/build-image-candidate-review-artifact` when installed.
For one editor-present article action, ADR-010 allows Toolbox to import the
reviewed external or AI-generated candidate and optionally set it as featured
through strong local confirmation. Existing attachments may also be selected
and inserted into visible editor state or set as featured. Batch, background,
external-Agent, replacement, and multi-object adoption still use the
Adapter/Core/Abilities path.
When Cloud includes an `ai_generation_handoff`, the Toolbox result can show a
reviewed-prompt hosted image candidate request. The action calls the Cloud
Addon runtime seam with `grok-imagine-image-quality`, returns host-generated
`image_candidate.v1` candidates. The editor reviews the prompt, image, source,
license state, filename, title, ALT, description, and final action before the
ADR-010 route may import one image. Cloud Addon remains transport only and does
not receive WordPress write authority.
The high-risk contrast remains governed: reviewed article/media batch plans
that include draft creation, media upload, media metadata, and featured-image
actions are submitted to Core as one `plan_to_proposal_batch` through
`npcink-toolbox/build-article-media-batch-write-plan`; they do not use Local
Admin Consent and do not write posts or media during proposal intake.
The selected-block toolbar also exposes compact paragraph actions: a paragraph
review button that returns clarity, fact-boundary, and tone notes without
replacement copy, plus an image-icon paragraph image suggestion button. The
image entry uses the selected paragraph or block as the primary context and
defaults to a media-import plan for later placement, while the sidebar
image-source entry
remains the article-level featured-image recommendation path.
The same image-source picker contract can be reused by future image fields,
including settings screens. Those callers may pass a manual query and optional
context, receive the selected `image_candidate.v1` plus media SEO suggestions,
and then hand off any setting or media write through the appropriate governed
ability path. Toolbox does not write setting values directly.
Image-source picker optimization stays lightweight in Toolbox and heavier in
Cloud. The reusable picker should provide one search box, concise candidate
cards, a selected-image inspector, media SEO fields, and selection/adoption
buttons that change by usage context. Cloud should optimize abstract article
topics into concrete visual queries, use site-context vectors for reranking,
dedupe near-identical candidates, filter low-quality or watermarked images,
return license/source/attribution evidence, and provide short query rewrites
when no images are found. Toolbox may cache recent modal results for a few
minutes and show those Cloud signals, but it must not own provider routing,
image indexing, settings writes, or long-term adoption history. The only local
media-library write in this picker is ADR-010's one-image, current-article,
strong-local-confirmation adoption transaction.

The post editor **Npcink Content Support** sidebar owns high-frequency Npcink
review and handoff actions because those actions need the current article
context: publish preflight, internal-link candidates, and image candidates.
Article narration and audio summary remain callable but temporarily hidden.
Generic writing, metadata, article-checkup,
discoverability, comment, and current-article ALT capabilities stay available
as compatible route-only or result-rendering paths rather than default visible
buttons. The admin
**Workflows** tab stays focused on site helpers, fallback
bundles, governed handoffs, and media planning rather than draft-side writing
buttons.
Site Check owns site-level content opportunity triage. The bounded
`content_snapshot_suggestions` helper remains route-only for hosted AI
composition, and reviewed draft write-plan contracts remain available only
through REST and Abilities for future bulk import or machine-client composition.
Media ALT/caption helper contracts remain available to editor-sidebar flows and
future batch review sets, where the operator has either current article context
or an explicit selected review set. In all cases, Toolbox samples only the
supplied public-site or media metadata, Cloud produces reviewable suggestions,
and no media library, post, SEO, proposal, crawler, or queue state is changed
locally.
Publish preflight, internal-link candidates, and image candidates are the
default editor sidebar buttons. Article narration and audio summary remain
callable compatibility flows but are temporarily hidden. Summary suggestions,
category suggestions, tag suggestions, article checkup, discoverability, and
current-article ALT checks stay route-compatible but are demoted from the
default button list to avoid duplicating generic AI plugin features.
Internal-link candidate assembly is delegated to
`npcink-abilities-toolkit/resolve-internal-link-targets`; Toolbox only passes
editor context plus optional Cloud Site Knowledge evidence and renders the
review/copy/open surface.
The admin **Image Handling** tab defaults to media work, with **Batch Optimize
Images** as the first visible workbench. Single-image ALT and optimization
actions start from the media-library attachment details panel or media list row
actions, then carry that attachment into the same selected-image workbenches
used for batches. The old `tab=image&tool=optimize` and
`toolbox_tab=tools&toolbox_tool=media-derivative` URLs are deprecated and fall
back to `tab=image&tool=batch-optimize`; Toolbox no longer exposes a standalone
one-image picker page. Media library bulk actions can send selected images to
`tab=image&tool=bulk-alt` or `tab=image&tool=batch-optimize`. Site helpers
remain secondary low-frequency checks, while content preparation and reviewed
handoffs live in their own admin surface.

`media_optimization_v1` names the fixed governed image optimization workflow,
not a new workflow runtime or persistent run store. Toolbox stores media
optimization defaults for the preview and handoff flow, accepts one-run
operator overrides, lets an operator start one image from the media library, and
lets selected media-library images enter a bounded batch workbench. The batch
workbench may ask Adapter/Core to approve and execute selected proposals after
previews exist; Core policy decides whether execution is allowed or the proposal
remains pending for review. Operators can request a bounded one-run
aspect-ratio crop before resize/watermark processing. Operators can keep the Toolbox default
watermark, disable it for the run, use a text watermark, or use the configured
Toolbox image/logo watermark source with one-run placement settings.
Text watermark overrides pass text, font, color, background, margin, position,
and opacity directly to the same Cloud request shape used by OpenClaw handoffs.
If an operator starts from a hard-coded
local uploads URL, the same surface can call the local read-only
`npcink-abilities-toolkit/resolve-media-attachment-by-url` ability through Adapter
`run-read-ability`, show bounded match evidence, and fill the attachment ID for
the same preview/proposal flow. The single-image action surface dispatches the
bounded media-derivative recipe through Cloud Addon, polls the short-lived Cloud
artifact result, and renders a separate `local_review` POST transport. Its
same-origin WordPress endpoint has no query string; the browser submits the
exact local11 artifact as JSON with cookie authentication and `X-WP-Nonce`.
Cloud Addon receives, verifies, and ACKs the bytes before Toolbox serves them
with no-store and nosniff headers. The browser renders the response through a
short-lived Blob object URL and revokes it on load, error, or re-render. The
Cloud `artifact` projection never contains this local endpoint, a remote URL, a
storage locator, or a self-signed credential. The surface can then submit
a Core replacement proposal with the artifact evidence. The
	Batch Optimize Images workbench can build a bounded batch conversion plan, show
	candidates and skipped reasons, generate selected previews, and submit selected
	items for review; final replacement execution stays in the governed
	Adapter/Core path outside the default admin workbench. The admin batch surface is intentionally
	a fixed operator flow: operators choose selected media or a media range and
	processing goal first, while exact ID, date, exclusion, and dimension filters remain in an
	advanced disclosure for exceptions. Toolbox
can also build a local media reference repair plan for exact hard-coded URL
matches and submit that plan to Core from-plan intake as `patch-post-content`
actions. For theme/plugin settings that store hard-coded media URLs, Toolbox can
build a filtered settings reference repair plan with excluded formats and minimum
image dimensions, then submit exact `patch-setting-value` actions to Core.
Toolbox does not store the site media policy, own Cloud credentials, create an
artifact registry, approve proposals, execute proposals, replace files, write
attachment metadata, patch post content, or update options/theme mods directly.
See [Media Optimization V1](docs/media-optimization-v1.md) for the fixed
workflow contract and expansion rule, and
[OpenClaw Batch Media Optimization Handoff](docs/openclaw-batch-media-optimization-handoff.md)
for the two-stage batch implementation order.

## Connector Configuration

Toolbox no longer stores provider keys for web search, public image-source
providers, or vector infrastructure. Configure Cloud connectivity in the Cloud
Addon and configure provider keys, routing, quotas, and health in the Cloud
operator surface.

Image-source search supports `auto`, `cloud`, and provider hints such as
`unsplash`, `pixabay`, or `pexels`, but the public provider keys and provider
selection live in Cloud. Toolbox sends one Cloud runtime request and returns a
normalized `image_source_candidates` payload for any AI caller that needs
images, whether the use case is article drafting, media planning, layout
suggestions, reference selection, or another image-dependent workflow.
When editor context is available, Toolbox includes only a truncated visual brief
input: image use, title/excerpt snippets, selected paragraph text, manual query,
and bounded candidate limits. Cloud may optimize the visual query and rerank
candidates with site-context vectors, but Toolbox only consumes the normalized
candidate list, match reasons, and optional media SEO suggestions.
Supported image-use labels include featured, paragraph, inline, and setting
image contexts. The label informs Cloud ranking and UI copy; it does not grant
write authority.
`ai_generated` remains explicit: the hosted path returns
`image_generation_result.v1` artifact references through Cloud Addon signed
transport. The route and ability ids keep legacy "image-generation" names for
compatibility only; Toolbox still does not own model routing, prompt
management, or provider billing. ADR-010 permits Toolbox to import exactly one
reviewed artifact and optionally set it as the current article's featured
image; all other final WordPress writes remain outside this exception.

Every returned image candidate is normalized to `image_candidate.v1` while
preserving legacy URL fields for existing callers. The normalized fields include
`source_type`, `provider`, `provider_origin`, `download_url`,
`thumbnail_url`, `prompt`, `model`, `license_review_status`, attribution,
provenance, and warnings. Stock providers return `source_type=stock`;
generated candidates return `source_type=ai_generated`.

Editor review surfaces can pass those already retrieved candidates to
`npcink-abilities-toolkit/build-image-candidate-review-artifact` to get a shared
`image_candidate_review.v1` artifact and `recommendation_candidate.v1`
projection. That Toolkit ability does not search providers, generate images,
download files, import media, or write WordPress state.

After an operator reviews one candidate, `npcink-abilities-toolkit/build-image-candidate-adoption-plan`
or `POST /wp-json/npcink-toolbox/v1/flows/image-candidate-adoption-plan`
can build an `image_candidate_adoption_plan`. That plan targets only
`npcink-abilities-toolkit/upload-media-from-url`, `npcink-abilities-toolkit/update-media-details`, and
optional `npcink-abilities-toolkit/set-post-featured-image` through Core proposal intake. It
does not import media, update metadata, set a featured image, or write
WordPress directly. The editor adoption flow uses Adapter `/proposals/from-plan`
when the author clicks the Core handoff action, displays the proposal receipt
and Governance Core link, then stops. Approval and execution continue only on
the governed surface.
The standalone admin `tool=image-candidate-adoption` surface is deprecated and
is not exposed as a Toolbox button; single-article image adoption belongs in the
post editor image recommendation sidebar, while batch adoption of new image
candidates requires a separate reviewed batch design.
For a selected image that is already a WordPress attachment, the editor may use
`POST /wp-json/npcink-toolbox/v1/local-admin-consent/featured-image` instead of
building an import proposal. That route is limited to one current post and one
existing image attachment, uses the shared operation classifier as
`local_admin_consent`, records Core audit events, and does not create a Core
proposal.

Cloud-managed web search is provided by Npcink Cloud. Toolbox no longer
stores local web search provider keys, registers a local web search ability,
or exposes a local web search REST route. AI workflows that need current
external evidence, comparison material, Chinese source lookup, source coverage,
product research, support context, or article preparation should call the Cloud
runtime and preserve returned source URLs in their evidence packs. Toolbox does
not verify truth, write WordPress content, or expose provider keys.

The legacy `vector-search` route is a compatibility pointer only.
Toolbox no longer stores vector provider keys, embedding models, dimensions,
provider endpoints, collection names, or local vector database settings. New
Ability callers should use Cloud-managed Site Knowledge for semantic site
context through `npcink-toolbox/search-site-knowledge`.

Cloud-managed site knowledge is the preferred high-level ability surface for
semantic site search, related content, writing context, internal-link
candidates, refresh suggestions, image-context lookup, FAQ candidates, content
gap analysis, and publish preflight duplicate checks. Toolbox registers
`search-site-knowledge`, `get-site-knowledge-status`, and
`request-site-knowledge-sync` as WordPress Abilities. These abilities call
Npcink Cloud through the Cloud Addon runtime seam or the
`npcink_toolbox_site_knowledge_cloud_request` host filter; Toolbox does not
store Cloud credentials, own vector collection lifecycle, or write WordPress
content.

Sync requests send bounded public WordPress manifests: published posts and
pages, plus recent approved comments attached to those indexed public entries.
Comment payloads include only public comment text and source IDs needed for
Cloud indexing; moderation, edits, deletion, and final writes remain local
WordPress responsibilities.

When Cloud Addon exposes `npcink_cloud_addon_site_knowledge_change_bridge_health()`,
it owns the public content-change bridge for Site Knowledge. Toolbox then shows
that bridge health under `change_bridge` in the Site Knowledge status response
and does not register its legacy local auto-sync hooks. `auto_sync` remains only
as a compatibility alias for older callers. Standalone installs without the
Cloud Addon bridge show an install-and-verify requirement instead of running a
Toolbox-owned fallback queue. Manual Site Knowledge sync remains as a
compatibility REST and Ability contract for existing callers, but the
operator-facing connection, refresh, indexing, and detailed delivery status
live in Cloud Addon. Toolbox does not store provider credentials, run embeddings
locally, own the index lifecycle, or write WordPress content.

Site Knowledge has one operator-facing home: Cloud Addon. It owns connection,
refresh, indexing, delivery status, retrieval acceptance, and diagnostics.
Toolbox keeps only the workflows that consume Cloud-managed results, such as
internal-link candidates, duplicate checks, publish preflight context, and
governed review handoff preparation.
Standalone Cloud diagnostics are not exposed in Toolbox. Cloud Addon owns the
WordPress-side Cloud connection, hosted runtime status, search/image-source
diagnostics, entitlement, quota, billing, request logs, and service health
detail. Toolbox keeps Cloud-backed calls inside explicit product workflows, and
single-image Core proposal submission, URL repair handoffs, and batch proposal
submission remain in **Image Handling**.

When **Optimize this image** is opened for exactly one Media Library attachment,
Toolbox shows a contextual single-image workbench inside the same fixed flow.
It supports format/size overrides, optional crop, reusable text/logo watermark
templates, and a safe output basename. The browser must verify the short-lived
preview and the operator must confirm replacement semantics before Toolbox can
authorize one request-scoped `adopt-cloud-media-derivative` Toolkit transaction.
The current contract replaces the selected attachment with backup, reference-
repair, verification, and rollback evidence without creating a Core proposal.
The completed workbench can list Toolkit-owned backups and restore one visibly
loaded, explicitly confirmed backup while backing up the current file first.
Toolbox does not offer save-as-new or own backup lifecycle execution.

Provider responses return normalized fields by default. Set **Include provider
raw responses** to include redacted raw provider payloads for debugging.
Production hosts can define `NPCINK_TOOLBOX_DISABLE_RAW_RESPONSES` to force raw
payloads off even if the local option is enabled.

For hardening release checks, run `composer smoke:security-permission-debug`
with the default gate. To capture an authenticated local or staging latency
baseline, set `NPCINK_TOOLBOX_BASE_URL` plus admin REST authentication headers
and run `composer perf:baseline`. The default command is local-only and records
one warmup plus ten measured `/status` requests with median and P95 timing;
Cloud-backed probes require an explicit, quota-aware opt-in. The release
checklist is documented in
[Security And Performance Release Gate](docs/security-performance-release-gate.md).

## Development

```bash
composer test:all
```

The current gate runs PHP syntax linting and static contract checks.
