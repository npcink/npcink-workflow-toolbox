# Article Writing Pack V1

Status: active contract for URL, manual, mixed, review, and draft-preview stages.

## Purpose

`article_writing_pack.v1` is the planning artifact that must exist before an
article draft preview can be requested. It is not an article body, translation,
workflow run, Core proposal, durable approval record, or WordPress write.

Three input modes populate the same contract:

- `url_reference`: one public URL plus inferred editorial direction;
- `manual_brief`: operator audience, goal, focus, and related fields without a
  claimed external fact source;
- `mixed`: exact URL evidence plus operator editorial fields, with operator
  preferences taking precedence over inference.

## Contract

}
```

Every inferred editorial field carries:

- `value`;
- `source`;
- `operator_confirmed=false`.

An explicit operator value may replace an inferred preference, but it must not
turn an unsupported claim into a verified fact. Source facts remain
grounded only in exact-source evidence; Site Knowledge remains overlap,
terminology, tone, and internal-reference context rather than proof about the
external source.

## Input Boundary

Accepted:

- `input_mode=url_reference` with one validated public `source_url`;
- `input_mode=manual_brief` with audience, article goal, and at least one focus
  point;
- `input_mode=mixed` with the URL plus typed editorial fields.

Not accepted:

- multiple source URLs;
- pasted source bodies or uploads.

The editor exposes typed audience, goal, reader problem, focus, angle, title,
promise, content type, outline, and additional-guidance fields. Unsupported
input modes fail explicitly instead of silently falling back.

The legacy `source_stage=adapt` input remains accepted for compatibility and
keeps the outer `source_adaptation_review.v1` wrapper while including the same
`sections.article_writing_pack` artifact. New clients use
`source_stage=research_plan` and receive `article_writing_pack.v1` as the
primary outer artifact.

## Simple Source-Body Gate

URL and mixed modes first trim Cloud Reader navigation before the exact
Markdown article-title heading, accepting a common publisher suffix such as
`– WordPress News`. If no matching heading exists, the source fails closed.
They proceed only when the remaining body
contains at least 600 cleaned characters and three sentence-ending punctuation
marks after URL text is removed. This deliberately small, transparent check rejects empty,
metadata-only, and navigation-only captures before hosted planning or draft
generation. A blocked pack carries
`source_body_evidence_insufficient`; confirmation cannot override it. Manual
brief mode is unaffected because it does not claim an external fact source.

Hosted planning receives up to 30,000 characters of that body through a
locale-independent bound. It does not use `wp_trim_words()` for this source
because Chinese WordPress locales interpret that limit as characters and can
silently reduce a long external article to a few hundred characters.

Writing-pack Site Knowledge requests use the additive Cloud-owned
`result_granularity=document` contract. Cloud filters and reranks chunk evidence,
keeps the best-ranked chunk for each source document, and returns unique article
candidates with bounded chunk references. Toolbox consumes that result and does
not implement a second semantic dedupe or relevance-scoring policy.

The default editor sidebar shows only the operator-facing `Draft from source
materials` entry and current request-scoped status. Its wide work modal maps the
existing stages to `Provide materials`, `Confirm direction`, and `Review draft`.
The first step owns input mode and URL or brief fields; the direction step keeps
audience, goal, focus, angle, and outline editable; the draft step owns review
and adoption actions. Raw Reader output, fact ledgers, overlap, rights, runtime
detail, and source notes remain available under compact lists or explicit
disclosures instead of occupying the main path. A failed URL extraction keeps
the first step recoverable: the operator may retry the same source or switch to
the manual brief without closing the modal.

## Review Contract

Draft generation requires one request-scoped `article_writing_pack_review.v1`:

```json
{
  "artifact_type": "article_writing_pack_review.v1",
  "status": "confirmed_by_operator",
  "base_content_fingerprint": "sha256:...",
  "review_fingerprint": "sha256:...",
  "article_generation_allowed": true,
  "authorization_scope": "single_synchronous_draft_preview_request",
  "durable_approval_state": false,
  "direct_wordpress_write": false
}
```

The server rejects absent confirmation, fingerprint mismatch, unsupported input
mode, or missing required fields. This is not `confirm_token`, Core approval,
or a local approval store. Editing any structured field in the UI clears the
confirmation checkbox.

## Draft Preview Boundary

The confirmed pack may produce `article_draft_preview.v1` with a title, excerpt,
ordered plain-text sections, fact references, verification notes, and source
attribution notes. The draft runtime must consume the reviewed pack and review
fingerprint; it must not reread a URL and silently choose a different direction.

The draft preview always remains:

- `suggestion_only`;
- `operator_review_required=true`;
- `direct_wordpress_write=false`;
- `body_insertion=false`;
- `body_replacement=false`.

These flags describe the hosted result: it never inserts or replaces article
content. After explicitly rating the current result `usable`, the editor may
load its ordered sections as native heading and paragraph blocks only when the
current Gutenberg body is empty. `usable_after_changes` must regenerate and be
reviewed again. The action rechecks both review status and emptiness at click
time, changes only visible editor memory, and never loads the generated title
or excerpt. A non-empty body
keeps only the copy path. Persistence still requires the author's normal
WordPress Save draft, Update, or Publish action; there is no REST write,
media-import, proposal, hidden save hook, or background action.

A separate explicit governed action is available only after the current draft
is rated `usable`. It maps ordered sections to bounded Markdown, preserving
verification and attribution notes as review evidence rather than body text,
then reuses `npcink-toolbox/build-article-write-plan` and Adapter's
`proposals/from-plan` route. The result is one pending dry-run
`npcink-abilities-toolkit/create-draft` proposal. Toolbox shows the ephemeral
receipt and Core link, then stops. Approval, preflight, execution, and the
resulting WordPress `draft` belong to Core, Adapter, and Toolkit; publication
remains a native human action. Regeneration or review changes clear the prior
receipt so it cannot be mistaken for the current draft.

## Request-Scoped Draft Review

After a draft preview is returned, the editor may collect one lightweight
`article_draft_review_feedback.v1` envelope:

- `status`: `usable`, `usable_after_changes`, or `not_usable`;
- `issue_codes`: a bounded subset of `fact_accuracy`, `site_tone`, `structure`,
  `source_similarity`, and `rights_attribution`;
- `notes`: a short operator revision instruction.

The feedback exists only in the current editor session. It is sent to the
hosted text runtime only when the operator explicitly requests another draft,
and it may guide editorial revision but may never become factual evidence. The
response may echo the sanitized envelope so the operator can see what informed
the latest regeneration.

The contract always keeps:

- `authorization_scope=single_draft_regeneration_request`;
- `durable_review_state=false`;
- `direct_wordpress_write=false`.

The editor may copy the plain-text preview to the clipboard, explicitly load
blocks into an empty current editor, or explicitly submit a `usable` preview to
the governed Core proposal path. Copy/load never saves or creates a proposal;
the governed path stops after proposal creation and never publishes. No review
database, acceptance history, learning profile, or automatic regeneration loop
is introduced in this version.

## Ownership

- Toolbox owns the editor composition, normalization, display, and feedback.
- Cloud owns exact-source reading, hosted text execution, and Site Knowledge.
- Cloud Addon remains signed transport only.
- Core, Adapter, and Toolkit keep their existing contracts: Core owns proposal
  truth and approval, Adapter executes only after approval, and Toolkit owns
  `create-draft`. Toolbox adds no second write or approval path.
