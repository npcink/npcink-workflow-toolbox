# ADR-001: Build Toolbox As A Product Surface

## Status

Accepted

## Date

2026-06-02

## Context

Npcink already has separate projects for governance and reusable WordPress
abilities:

- `npcink-governance-core` governs proposal records, approvals, preflight, and audit.
- `npcink-abilities-toolkit` registers reusable WordPress Abilities API definitions.

The desired new functionality includes external web research, image-source
search, vector search, and fixed-flow operator buttons. These features are
product-facing and provider-facing. They need admin UX and workflow affordances,
but they should not turn Core into a provider gateway or turn Abilities into a
semantic runtime.

## Decision

Create `npcink-toolbox` as a standalone WordPress plugin.

Toolbox owns the operator-facing product surface for external tools and fixed
workflow buttons. Npcink Cloud owns web search provider configuration and
execution. Toolbox may call Cloud-managed image-source providers,
Cloud-managed site knowledge, and future non-search connector APIs for bounded
suggestion tasks and may register its actions through the WordPress Abilities
API.

For workflows that also exist as OpenClaw recipes, Toolbox buttons are the
click-driven operator surface for the same local ability, plan artifact, Adapter
recipe, and Core proposal contracts. Toolbox must not create a parallel recipe
owner, approval path, workflow runtime, media registry, prompt/model control
plane, or WordPress write executor.

Toolbox does not own final WordPress write approval, Core audit truth, reusable
first-party WordPress ability packs, queues, MCP, Agent Gateway, or OpenClaw
control-plane state.

## Alternatives Considered

### Add These Features To Core

Pros:

- Core already has governance context.
- Fewer plugins in the short term.

Cons:

- Would mix governance truth with provider execution.
- Would pressure Core to store provider keys and runtime state.
- Conflicts with Core's governance-only boundary.

Rejected.

### Add These Features To Abilities

Pros:

- Abilities already exposes callable operations.
- Ability ids and schemas would be easy to discover.

Cons:

- External search, image-source lookup, embeddings, and vector search depend on
  provider/runtime ownership.
- Abilities is meant to remain a reusable WordPress ability package, not a
  semantic/model runtime.

Rejected for the main plugin. Toolbox can still register its actions through
the Abilities API.

### Keep Everything In A Host Runtime

Pros:

- Host can manage provider keys, quotas, logs, and runtime policy centrally.

Cons:

- Operators still need a visible WordPress product surface.
- Fixed workflow buttons would be harder to iterate independently.

Rejected as the only surface. Host/runtime integration remains a future option.

## Consequences

- Toolbox can evolve as a product plugin without weakening Core or Abilities.
- Provider configuration is acceptable for MVP, but durable billing, quotas,
  request logs, and key rotation may later move to connector plugins.
- Write-like actions must hand off to WordPress abilities and Core governance.
- Long-running workflows require a future runtime decision before implementation.
- Cloud-managed web search results must be treated as source candidates, not
  verified truth. Toolbox must not store local web search provider keys,
  register a local web search REST route, or expose a local web search
  ability.
- Unsplash, Pixabay, and Pexels must be treated as image-source connectors with
  attribution/source metadata, not as AI image-generation providers. Unsplash
  candidates must preserve download tracking. AI-generated image candidates are
  a separate explicit mode that may use a host runtime seam. Toolbox must not
  own model routing, prompt management, or provider billing. ADR-017 restores
  this ADR's original boundary: media import and candidate featured-image
  adoption remain outside Toolbox and use Adapter/Core/Toolkit.
- Vector provider configuration, embedding, indexing, re-index jobs, rerank,
  and vector collection lifecycle belong to Cloud-managed Site Knowledge, not
  local Toolbox settings.
