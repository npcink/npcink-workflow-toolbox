## Short Description

Fixed AI workflow buttons for WordPress operators, with review-only suggestions and governed handoff plans.

## Reviewer Note

Npcink Workflow Toolbox is a review-only WordPress operator surface for fixed AI-assisted content and site-operations workflows. It returns suggestions, candidates, previews, and governed handoff plans. It does not publish posts, approve proposals, import media, create terms, update SEO metadata, mutate media metadata, or run a local workflow queue as part of the default content-support flow.

Cloud-backed features require a connected Npcink Cloud Addon or compatible host runtime. Npcink Cloud is the official Npcink hosted runtime service. The plugin does not include or hard-code a Cloud service endpoint; administrators connect the runtime through a companion connector or host-provided filters.

## Name And Ownership Note

The public name and slug intentionally use `Npcink` because this is the
official Npcink Workflow Toolbox product surface. If WordPress.org asks for
brand ownership clarification, reply with the official owner account or email
evidence, or request transfer to the official owner account before continuing
review. Do not rename the plugin in code unless the product owner decides this
is no longer an official Npcink listing.

The WordPress.org-facing `readme.txt` Contributors line must include the
submitting account `muze233` before upload.

## Directory Assets

Source files are kept in `wporg-assets/source/`. WordPress.org-ready PNGs are prepared in `wporg-assets/`.

Upload or copy these files to the WordPress.org plugin SVN top-level `assets/` directory:

- `wporg-assets/icon-128x128.png` -> `assets/icon-128x128.png`
- `wporg-assets/icon-256x256.png` -> `assets/icon-256x256.png`
- `wporg-assets/banner-772x250.png` -> `assets/banner-772x250.png`
- `wporg-assets/banner-1544x500.png` -> `assets/banner-1544x500.png`
- `wporg-assets/screenshot-1.png` -> `assets/screenshot-1.png`
- `wporg-assets/screenshot-2.png` -> `assets/screenshot-2.png`
- `wporg-assets/screenshot-3.png` -> `assets/screenshot-3.png`
- `wporg-assets/screenshot-4.png` -> `assets/screenshot-4.png`

These assets are intentionally excluded from the plugin release zip by `.distignore`.
Do not upload local metadata files such as `.DS_Store`.

## Release Package

Use the release zip generated from the intended release commit:

```bash
composer package:release
```

For a mixed worktree, generate the release package from a clean worktree or release tag so unrelated local edits do not enter the zip.

The accepted submission package path is:

```text
/Users/muze/gitee/npcink-workflow-toolbox/build/npcink-workflow-toolbox.zip
```

The package root must be `npcink-workflow-toolbox/`.

## Validation Commands

Before submitting the plugin zip:

```bash
composer check:wporg
composer test:all
```

Then run the Plugin Check package gate with the workstation environment
documented in the
[WordPress.org Release Gate](wordpress-org-release-gate.md)
(wp-cli.phar plus the Local site path and MySQL socket); the 0.3.0 publication
used:

```bash
SOCK="$HOME/Library/Application Support/Local/run/s63K4c8XP/mysql/mysqld.sock"
WP_CLI=/tmp/wp-cli.phar WP_CLI_PHP=/opt/homebrew/bin/php \
WP_PATH="/Users/muze/Local Sites/magick-ai/app/public" \
WP_DB_SOCKET="$SOCK" composer plugin-check:release
```
