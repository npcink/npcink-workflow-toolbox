# Product Positioning

Media Library optimization uses a simple default flow: choose a time and image-type range, inspect representative Cloud-qualified samples, confirm once, then watch foreground progress and use batch history for restore. Encoding choices, quality thresholds, fingerprints, Providers, and Artifact details stay out of the default surface. Advanced one-image processing remains separate.

Status: active for the first Toolbox build.

Npcink Workflow Toolbox is the WordPress operator-facing AI workflow surface:
it gives site owners and editors fixed buttons for Cloud-managed web search,
Cloud-managed image-source candidates, Cloud-managed site knowledge abilities,
and repeatable AI-assisted content-support workflows.

## One-Sentence Positioning

Npcink Workflow Toolbox turns proven AI-assisted WordPress operations and
content-support abilities into fixed, review-only buttons for site operators.

## Relationship To External AI Clients And OpenClaw

Toolbox and external AI clients should expose the same governed workflows through
different operator entry points:

- Npcink AI Client Adapter is the generic external AI-client contract.
- OpenClaw is the first and priority natural-language implementation.
- Toolbox is the fixed-button product surface for the same repeatable flows.
- Adapter projects Toolkit-owned workflow definitions into client-specific
  recipes and forwards reviewed plans.
- Core owns proposal, approval, preflight, and final WordPress write truth.
- Abilities execute the reusable WordPress read/write callbacks.
- Cloud may provide hosted runtime processing, but not write authority.

When a workflow can be used both by an external AI client and by a Toolbox button, the
Toolbox button should reuse the same ability ids, plan artifact shapes, and
Core proposal handoff as the Adapter projection. The reusable, versioned,
static workflow definition is owned by `npcink-abilities-toolkit`. Toolbox and
Adapter must not fork it into a separate workflow registry, approval path,
media registry, prompt/model control plane, or WordPress write executor.

OpenClaw-specific REST names may remain for compatibility. Channels with
materially different authentication, transport, lifecycle, or durable state
may use separate adapter plugins instead of distorting the common contract.

## Two Write Lanes

The product has two intentionally different commit paths:

- In the article editor, reviewed values may enter the current article's
  visible and editable editor state. They become durable only when the author
  uses normal WordPress Publish or Update. This `native_editor_commit` path
  does not create a Core proposal or Core audit record.
- For one fully previewed image in the current article, an editor-present
  `strong_local_confirmation` action may import one external or AI-generated
  image and optionally set it as featured under ADR-010.
- In plugin-admin batch execution surfaces, selected writes become Core
  proposals unless an accepted ADR defines a narrower bounded lane. ADR-015 is
  the sole current exception: one present administrator confirms an exact
  media SHA-256 manifest and Toolkit owns every replacement and restore.

The native-editor rule applies only to the current article and its normal save
transaction. Under ADR-014, one explicit action may apply at most eight
individually reviewed internal links to the current article's visible editor
state without becoming a governed batch merely because it has multiple
selections. ADR-010 separately permits one immediate, reversible media import
for the same present editor after an exact preview and explicit confirmation.
Hidden post-save execution, replacement, cross-object/global writes,
external/background actions, and governed batches remain on the Core proposal
path. Cross-post insertion and backend content patching are governed writes,
not native editor commits.

Toolbox must not fork the flow
into a separate approval path, media registry, prompt/model control plane, or
WordPress write executor.

For batch workflows, the order is stricter: prove the OpenClaw/Adapter batch
contract first, including execution profiles, Core approval/preflight evidence,
per-action results, retry guidance, and Abilities write callbacks; only then
freeze the accepted path into a Toolbox button. Toolbox is the fixed-button
best-practice projection of OpenClaw, not the place to invent batch execution
semantics.

## Primary Users

- WordPress administrators who want controlled AI tools without touching raw
  provider APIs.
- Editors who need taxonomy/tag, internal-link, image-source, SEO/AEO/GEO, and
  publish-readiness support around human-written articles.
- Npcink operators who need fixed workflow buttons that produce reviewable
  handoffs.

## Core Jobs

1. Provide a visible admin product surface for external AI tools.
2. Run Cloud-managed external search request handoff, optional result reading,
   Cloud-managed image-source requests, and Cloud-managed site knowledge
   operations from a controlled WordPress UI.
3. Convert repeated operator workflows into fixed buttons.
4. Return planning artifacts, candidates, and handoff notes.
5. Let operators fill non-secret SEO, AEO, and GEO content context for
   suggestion workflows and third-party AI callers.
6. Prioritize work around the article body: taxonomy/tag candidates,
   internal-link candidates, image candidates, SEO/AEO/GEO briefs, media
   metadata plans, and publish/readiness checks.
7. Keep final article acceptance and WordPress persistence with human editors;
   keep the retired Article Assistant generic route as compatibility only. A
   confirmed `article_writing_pack.v1` may request one structured, review-only
   draft preview through the existing hosted content-support seam.
8. Let editors review one external source against Cloud Site Knowledge vectors
   and receive `article_writing_pack.v1`: a bounded, source-grounded planning
   artifact with inferred audience, priorities, facts, overlap, angle, and
   outline, without generating, inserting, or publishing an article body.
9. Treat `media_optimization_v1` as the fixed governed media optimization
   workflow, improving the Media Library image actions and Batch Optimize
   Images surface rather than creating a duplicate runner.
10. Retain the Site Check compatibility route for bounded local review while it
   is hidden from the default operator UI pending a clearer problem statement,
   action model, and acceptance loop. The retained route preserves its bounded
   ranked decision list without expanding Toolbox runtime or write ownership.
11. Preserve Core and Abilities boundaries for final WordPress writes.

## Non-Goals

Npcink Workflow Toolbox does not own:

- Core proposal records, approvals, audit logs, or app-key governance;
- reusable WordPress ability packages owned by `npcink-abilities-toolkit`;
- final WordPress write execution;
- provider marketplace, billing, long-term quota, request-log products, or
  multi-provider routing;
- workflow runtime, queues, retry leases, or background schedulers;
- MCP, Agent Gateway, Open API, or OpenClaw projection truth.

## Product Split

| Project | Owns |
| --- | --- |
| `npcink-governance-core` | Governance, proposal records, approval boundaries, audit logs, and host policy. |
| `npcink-abilities-toolkit` | Reusable WordPress Abilities API definitions, schemas, callbacks, dry-run previews, and reusable versioned static workflow definitions. |
| `npcink-ai-client-adapter` | Generic external AI-client contract and channel projections, with OpenClaw implemented first. |
| `npcink-workflow-toolbox` | Operator tool UI, fixed workflow buttons, content discoverability context, Cloud-managed external research handoff, optional result reading, Cloud-managed image-source candidates, and Cloud-managed site knowledge actions. Runtime REST routes, ability ids, options, and hook names keep the first-version `npcink-toolbox` contract for compatibility. |
| Provider connector plugins | Durable provider configuration, key rotation, quotas, billing, and request logs when those surfaces mature. |

`wp-magick-toolbox` is an independent plugin with no migration, compatibility,
release, or ownership relationship to `npcink-workflow-toolbox`.

## Design Rule

If a feature is a button or screen that helps an operator generate a suggestion,
candidate, or planning artifact, it may belong in Toolbox.

If a feature lets an operator fill non-secret site guidance that third-party AI
can consume as suggestion-only context, it may belong in Toolbox.

If a feature summarizes local public-site evidence into ranked operational
findings, suggested actions, blocked items, or Core handoff candidates without
executing those actions, it may belong in Toolbox.

If a feature needs heavier semantic ranking, trend explanation, anomaly
diagnosis, or multi-source operations analysis, Toolbox should prepare a
bounded request contract and leave the complex execution to Cloud runtime/detail
surfaces.

If a feature authorizes, commits, audits, schedules, or owns final WordPress
writes, it belongs outside Toolbox.

Default buttons should solve around-the-body work before offering article draft
previews. The writing-pack exception is acceptable only after structured human
review and confirmation. Its hosted result remains plain-text suggestion output;
the editor may explicitly map reviewed sections into native blocks only when the
current Gutenberg body is empty, with persistence left to normal WordPress save.
Any later governed cross-object or automated write still belongs outside Toolbox.

Media optimization is the first fixed governed media workflow. The default
Media Library Optimization surface follows ADR-015: Toolbox freezes an exact
SHA-256 manifest, shows representative Cloud-qualified samples, and records one
present-administrator confirmation before delegating each replacement or restore
to Toolkit. Cloud owns derivative analysis and short-lived Artifacts; Toolkit
owns file replacement, backup, verification, lineage, and restore. This narrow
lane creates no Core proposal and cannot be used by agents, Cron, background
execution, or arbitrary transforms. Toolbox must not add a workflow runtime,
persistent run table, media registry, approval path, provider routing UI, or a
second media replacement implementation. Advanced and external-client media
flows retain their separately documented review and governance boundaries.

Batch media ALT follows the same boundary with a narrower contract. Toolbox may
submit one visually confirmed, missing-only `media_alt_apply_plan.v1` per image
through Adapter to Core, then stop. It does not approve, execute, poll, overwrite
existing ALT, or include caption/title/description changes. OpenClaw uses the
same Toolkit plan and Adapter execution profile.

High-frequency article support belongs in the WordPress post editor as a
Toolbox-owned panel, not only on the standalone Toolbox admin page. The editor
panel defaults to fixed flows for publish preflight, internal-link candidates,
current-article contextual ALT review, and image candidates. Article narration
and article audio summary remain callable compatibility flows but are
temporarily hidden from the default menu. Summary, category, tag, outline,
discoverability, and article-checkup remain supported route or rendering paths,
not default visible buttons. They must keep the same suggestion-only and
Core-governed write posture as the admin surface. Related existing-post review
belongs inside publish preflight duplicate-risk checks and the unified site
citation flow rather than a separate editor intent. Site citation candidates
are manual review aids, publish preflight is a unified advisory
review panel, SEO metadata is only a single-post Core handoff preview, and new
vocabulary remains Core policy-gated strong review.

The editor may also expose one URL-reference article-writing-pack flow that
combines bounded Cloud reader evidence with related Site Knowledge passages.
It returns `article_writing_pack.v1` with editorial direction, fact ledger,
overlap/style signals, distinct angle, outline guidance, and risk checks.
`url_reference`, `manual_brief`, and `mixed` populate the same
`source_materials` and `editorial_brief` contract. After the operator edits and
confirms the pack, Toolbox may request one `article_draft_preview.v1` from the
hosted text runtime. The preview is structured plain text, never a translated
replacement body. A separate explicit native-editor action may load sections
only into an empty current Gutenberg body; it never saves or publishes.
After the operator rates a preview `usable`, a second explicit action may map
the reviewed sections into the existing `article_write_plan`, submit that plan
through Adapter to Core, and then stop with a proposal receipt and Core review
link. Only approved Adapter/Toolkit execution may create a WordPress post with
status `draft`; an author or editor still publishes it with native WordPress.
The sidebar entry is named `Draft from source materials`, stays deliberately
small, and reports only the current request-scoped status. A wide three-step
modal owns source or brief input, writing-direction confirmation, and draft
review. Reader output, related-site evidence, fact/rights risk, and runtime
details stay behind compact secondary lists or disclosures. Draft review then
offers either optional Core handoff or empty-body adoption without changing the
write boundary.
Detailed brief fields and evidence remain behind optional/advanced disclosure.
Navigation or metadata-only reader output stops before hosted planning and can
never be confirmed into a draft.

For the current article only, an author clicking the editor's reviewed SEO,
external-image adoption, or article-audio adoption action is the approval step.
Toolbox creates the Core proposal and stores only its bounded proposal id on the
draft. Adapter/Abilities execution begins after the next successful native
Publish or Update, never on the adoption click itself. Attempted intents are
removed after that save and failures stay visible in Core without an automatic
retry loop. The private control metadata never enters the native Gutenberg post
payload, and completion does not trigger a second article save. This narrow
editor handoff does not apply to batch admin actions.

The contextual ALT exception is editor-state only: one administrator action
generates and automatically fills missing `core/image` ALT in Gutenberg memory
after Core local-consent audit. Article context remains primary; only absent
context may use the existing Cloud visual-evidence runtime silently, without a
new control or blocking state. Existing ALT and attachment-global ALT remain
unchanged, and native WordPress Save draft or Update is still the persistence
action.

Unsplash, Pixabay, and Pexels are image-source connectors, not AI
image-generation connectors. Toolbox must preserve attribution and source
metadata in its candidate payloads; Unsplash candidates must also preserve
download tracking metadata. Host-generated image candidates are a separate
explicit candidate mode: callers may provide reviewed generated image URLs, or
a host may provide a bounded generated-image runtime seam. The legacy
route/ability ids may still say "image-generation" for compatibility, but
Toolbox must not own model routing, prompt management, or provider billing.
One reviewed local import may use ADR-010; Cloud still owns only candidate
runtime and transport. Keep this seam aligned with
`docs/adversarial-boundary-review.md` and `docs/boundary-exceptions.md` so the
compatibility name does not become new runtime ownership.

Cloud-managed Site Knowledge is the vector surface. Toolbox may collect bounded
public WordPress manifests for explicit sync requests, show returned status, and
call semantic site search. Automatic public content-change delivery belongs in
Cloud Addon after its bridge is installed and verified; Toolbox no longer keeps
a standalone legacy fallback queue. Embedding providers, vector database
endpoints, collection names, dimensions, rerank, stale detection, and index
lifecycle are Cloud operator responsibilities. Toolbox must not act as an
active Jina Reader/Reranker runtime or expose Jina toggles before a separate
Cloud-owned workflow contract exists; it may only display Cloud-returned
ranking or extraction evidence as result detail.

The disabled Local Fallback WP-Cron dry-run preview is an accepted boundary
exception documented in `docs/boundary-exceptions.md`, ADR-004, and ADR-005. It
is not Toolbox-owned runtime lifecycle, scheduler truth, queue ownership, retry
policy, lease storage, run recovery, Core proposal creation, Cloud calls, or
WordPress writes.

Cloud-managed site knowledge is the preferred high-level surface for semantic
site search, related content, writing context, internal links, refresh
suggestions, and image context. Toolbox may expose these as local WordPress
Abilities while Cloud owns embeddings, vector storage, indexing, reranking, and
status detail. Toolbox must not store Cloud credentials or become the content
index lifecycle owner.
