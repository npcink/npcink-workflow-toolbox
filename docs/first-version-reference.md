# First Version Reference

Status: active handoff note for future AI sessions.

This file summarizes the first working shape of `npcink-toolbox` after the
provider, Abilities API, settings, lifecycle, and local smoke-test work.

## Product Boundary

Npcink Toolbox is an operator-facing AI tool plugin. It returns suggestions,
source candidates, image candidates, vector matches, and planning artifacts.

Toolbox must not:

- commit WordPress writes;
- import media or set featured images directly;
- own Core approval, audit, or proposal records;
- own workflow runtime, queue, scheduler, MCP, Agent Gateway, or OpenClaw state;
- own OpenClaw, Agent Gateway, Open API, or MCP projection truth;
- own WordPress content indexing, re-indexing, stale-index detection, or vector
  collection lifecycle;
- leak provider keys into logs, REST responses, proposals, docs, prompts, or
  handoff text.

Write-like outcomes must be handed to WordPress abilities and Npcink Governance Core
proposal approval.

## Providers

Current runtime providers:

| Capability | Provider | Runtime status |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cloud-managed web search | Npcink Cloud | General external source candidates. Cloud owns provider configuration and routing. |
| Image source candidates | Unsplash | Active provider; preserve attribution and `download_location`. |
| Image source candidates | Pixabay | Active provider when configured; preserve attribution and source URL. |
| Image source candidates | Pexels | Active provider when configured; preserve attribution and source URL. |
| Host-generated image candidates | Caller URL or host filter | Explicit `ai_generated` mode; preserve prompt/model evidence and human license review status. |
| Site knowledge vector infrastructure | Npcink Cloud | Cloud-managed embedding, vector storage, indexing, rerank, status, and search. |

## Cloud-Managed Vector

Toolbox no longer configures vector providers locally. The legacy
`vector-search` REST route returns a Cloud-managed site knowledge compatibility
pointer. New Ability callers should use `search-site-knowledge`,
`get-site-knowledge-status`, and `request-site-knowledge-sync`.

Toolbox must not store vector provider keys, embedding models, dimensions,
provider endpoints, collection names, rerank settings, or vector lifecycle
controls.

## Settings And Secrets

The settings page supports stored options plus env/constant fallback.

Provider connector settings are stored in:

```text
npcink_toolbox_settings
```

Secrets:

- `TAVILY_API_KEY` / `NPCINK_TOOLBOX_TAVILY_API_KEY`
- `BOCHA_API_KEY` / `NPCINK_TOOLBOX_BOCHA_API_KEY`

Provider raw payloads are excluded by default. Enable
`include_raw_responses` only for debugging.

The first version is single-site global configuration. Do not add multisite or
per-user isolation without a new decision.

Toolbox does not expose a Cloud Checks or Troubleshooting Checks panel in the
first version. Cloud connection checks, hosted runtime health, provider/search
or image diagnostics, Cloud API key verification, entitlement, billing, quota,
request logs, and service monitoring belong in Cloud Addon or Cloud
service-plane surfaces. Toolbox keeps task-owned product panels only: Content
Library Usage for read-only Site Knowledge status/result consumption,
Site Check for manual site reports, Morning Brief for scheduled-review
preview and local fallback settings, and Image Handling for selected-media
review/handoff flows. Nightly Inspection Cloud run recent/status/result/retry
detail lives in the Cloud Addon Runtime Runs tab.
Cloud runtime routes may remain bounded compatibility call sites for those workflows.
Standalone diagnostics do not live in Toolbox. Marketplace, provider routing,
vector provider settings, and vector lifecycle controls do not belong in
Toolbox.

The admin page should default to Overview. The visible top-level tabs are
Overview, Site Profile, and Image Handling; Site Check, Site Knowledge, and
Morning Brief remain hidden compatibility/deep-link panels. Overview should not
render a single-post article-support work block.
Article-specific jobs use the editor Content Support sidebar:
publish preflight, internal links, and image candidates. Article narration and
article audio summary remain callable but are temporarily hidden from the
default menu. Summary, category, tag, outline, discoverability,
article-checkup, current-article ALT, and related existing-post helpers remain
compatible route or rendering paths, so `writing_support` remains
route-compatible but is not a default editor button.
Site Check is temporarily hidden from the default operator UI while its
problem statement, action model, and acceptance loop are reassessed. The stable `operations-insights` deep link remains capability-gated for compatibility and still opens the same panel. It
builds a manual local `site_ops_insight_pack.v1` from bounded public content,
approved-comment signal counts, media metadata, taxonomy summaries, Site
Context readiness, and Cloud availability, then presents the current run as a
ranked review list for manual handling, existing fixed workflows, or optional Cloud
detail. Coverage metrics, lightweight charts, deterministic local summary,
content, media, comments, structure, findings, Cloud detail, and advanced data
views remain supporting detail.
It does not call Cloud, persist run state, schedule jobs, create Core proposals,
or write WordPress data. It may also render a copyable
`site_ops_cloud_analysis_request.v1`; generating that request still does not
send it or create local runtime state. When Cloud is ready, an administrator
can explicitly run Cloud detail and review the suggestion-only
`site_ops_cloud_analysis_result.v1` without Toolbox creating a local queue,
local run table, Core proposal, or WordPress write.
The low-frequency Scheduled Review path is the **Scheduled Review** sub tab
inside Site Check. **Current Check** contains the ordinary manual report.
`toolbox_tab=advanced` may remain only as a compatibility alias into the
hidden Site Check panel instead of rendering a separate directory or listing
Site Check detail and Scheduled Review preview as parallel choices.
`toolbox_tab=morning-brief` may remain only as a compatibility alias that opens
the Scheduled Review sub tab. Scheduled Review uses the Nightly/Morning Brief
preview and folded optional local fallback settings, but it is not presented as
a second site-check product. Its Cloud run recovery action links to Cloud Addon
Runtime Runs instead of rendering run recovery controls locally.
The admin Image Handling tab defaults to Image Optimization, with
Batch Optimize Images as the first visible workbench. Single-image actions
start from the WordPress media-library attachment details panel or image row
actions, then carry that attachment into Batch Image ALT or Batch Optimize
Images. The old `tab=image&tool=optimize` and
`toolbox_tab=tools&toolbox_tool=media-derivative` URLs are deprecated and fall
back to `tab=image&tool=batch-optimize`; Toolbox no longer exposes a standalone
one-image picker page. The media library bulk action can send selected
attachment IDs into Batch Image ALT or Batch Optimize Images, while Toolbox
owns the review, preview, and Core handoff workspace. It does not expose the former single-article Image Text Checks tool or the saved-post Media Brief tool.
Article-level featured-image recommendation and media brief planning belong in the editor sidebar. Batch
Image ALT is a separate selected media-library review-set surface that can
prepare a local handoff preview without scanning the whole library, creating
proposals, approving, executing, or writing media metadata.
The separate Content Review tab and standalone content opportunity tool are
retired. Site content opportunity review belongs in Site Check; the
bounded `content_snapshot_suggestions` helper remains route-only/internal for
hosted AI composition.
Reviewed draft write plans remain route/Ability-only for future import
workflows and machine clients. The old article-brief, article-assistant, and
article-plan URLs remain compatibility paths that fall back to Site Check, not
operator-facing admin tools. Batch media entry points use
`tab=image&tool=bulk-alt` and `tab=image&tool=batch-optimize`;
deprecated `tool=optimize` and legacy `toolbox_tool=media-derivative` URLs
canonicalize to Batch Optimize Images. The
lower-level `taxonomy_tags` intent remains available to the route but is not a
separate default button in the editor UI.

## Content Discoverability Context

The admin page also includes an operator-filled Site Context form for SEO,
AEO, and GEO guidance. It is stored separately from connector settings:

```text
npcink_toolbox_content_context
```

This option may contain:

- site positioning;
- target audience;
- brand voice;
- primary, long-tail, and entity keywords;
- allowed claims and forbidden claims;
- SEO, AEO, and GEO rules;
- toggles for FAQ, AEO summary, GEO summary, and structured data suggestions;
- fields that third-party AI may suggest in proposal-ready outputs.

It must not contain provider keys, private credentials, billing details, quotas,
request logs, or final write authorization.

The Abilities payload is read-only and fixed to:

```text
write_posture: suggestion_only
final_write_path: core_proposal_required
direct_wordpress_write: false
```

## Abilities API

Toolbox ability ids stay under `npcink-toolbox/*`:

- `npcink-toolbox/search-image-source`
- `npcink-toolbox/generate-image`
- `npcink-toolbox/search-site-knowledge`
- `npcink-toolbox/cloud-web-search`
- `npcink-toolbox/get-site-knowledge-status`
- `npcink-toolbox/request-site-knowledge-sync`
- `npcink-toolbox/build-article-write-plan`
- `npcink-abilities-toolkit/build-image-candidate-adoption-plan`
- `npcink-toolbox/build-site-knowledge-review-plan`
- `npcink-toolbox/build-nightly-inspection-review-plan`
- `npcink-toolbox/build-media-derivative-handoff`
- `npcink-toolbox/get-content-discoverability-context`
- `npcink-toolbox/validate-content-discoverability-context`
- `npcink-toolbox/build-content-discoverability-brief`
- `npcink-toolbox/build-ai-article-writing-pack`

General-purpose provider abilities:

- Cloud-managed web search is the external source-candidate capability for any
  workflow that needs web evidence, comparison material, Chinese source lookup,
  public references, support context, source coverage, or article preparation.
  Npcink Cloud owns provider configuration and execution; Toolbox does not
  register a local search ability.
- `npcink-toolbox/search-image-source` is the image-candidate ability for
  any workflow that needs sourced images. It returns `image_candidate.v1`
  candidates for stock, AI-generated, owned, or external image sources.
- `npcink-toolbox/generate-image` is the reviewed-prompt AI image candidate
  ability exposed when Cloud image-source results include an
  `ai_generation_handoff`. It calls hosted image generation through Cloud
  Addon, returns candidates only, and does not import media or write
  WordPress.
- `npcink-abilities-toolkit/build-image-candidate-adoption-plan` turns one reviewed
  `image_candidate.v1` into a Core-ready `image_candidate_adoption_plan` for
  media upload, metadata, and optional featured-image proposal intake.
  This is consumed by editor-side image adoption and machine clients, not by a
  standalone Toolbox admin button. The old `tool=image-candidate-adoption`
  admin URL is deprecated and should fall back to Site Check.
- `npcink-toolbox/search-site-knowledge` is the Cloud-managed site knowledge
  ability for semantic site search, related content, writing context, internal
  links, refresh suggestions, or image context. When Cloud returns
  `agent_handoff`, Toolbox displays it as a local Core proposal candidate only;
  the operator may prepare a local candidate packet for review or submit a
  blocked Core review proposal through `site_knowledge_review_plan`, but
  Toolbox does not approve, pass preflight, or execute the proposal.
- `npcink-toolbox/build-site-knowledge-review-plan` turns a Cloud Site
  Knowledge `proposal_input` into a Core-only `site_knowledge_review_plan`.
  It preserves evidence refs, targets only a non-ready
  `npcink-abilities-toolkit/create-draft` review action, requires human
  `title` and `content` input, and does not generate or write WordPress
  content.
- `/vector-search` is a Cloud-managed site knowledge compatibility REST route
  for older clients. It is no longer registered as a public Toolbox ability.

Site knowledge status and sync:

- `npcink-toolbox/get-site-knowledge-status` reads Cloud-managed coverage
  and freshness state.
- `npcink-toolbox/request-site-knowledge-sync` remains a compatibility contract
  for existing callers. Operator-facing refresh and detailed delivery status
  live in Cloud Addon; the ability does not write WordPress content and does
  not create a local indexing queue.

Site Knowledge Agent handoff acceptance:

- Cloud may return evidence-backed `agent_handoff` and `proposal_input`.
- Toolbox may render `Governed handoff`, `Agent proposal input`, and a local
  `site_knowledge_core_proposal_candidate` packet for operator review.
- The local candidate packet must keep `core_submission=not_submitted`,
  `direct_wordpress_write=false`, and `final_writes=core_proposal_required`.
- Toolbox may submit the reviewed handoff only as
  `npcink-toolbox/build-site-knowledge-review-plan` with
  `artifact_type=site_knowledge_review_plan`.
- The Core proposal created from that plan must remain blocked/not ready until a
  human supplies draft `title` and `content`; Toolbox must not approve it, run
  preflight, or execute WordPress writes.
- Core remains the only owner of proposal approval, commit preflight, audit, and
  final WordPress writes.

Post editor content support:

- `POST /wp-json/npcink-toolbox/v1/editor/content-support` runs one bounded
  fixed flow from the current draft context.
- Supported intents are `source_adaptation_review`, `writing_support`, `publish_preflight`,
  `summary_suggestions`, `category_suggestions`, `tag_suggestions`,
  `summary_terms_optimization`, `taxonomy_tags`, `internal_links`,
  `image_candidates`, selection-only paragraph review via `polish_notes`, and
  `discoverability`.
- The editor UI shows default buttons for `source_adaptation_review`,
  `publish_preflight`, `category_suggestions`, `tag_suggestions`,
  `internal_links`, `image_alt_suggestions`, and `image_candidates`.
  `article_narration` and `article_audio_summary` remain callable but
  temporarily hidden. Writing, summary, broader taxonomy, outline,
  discoverability, and article-checkup helpers remain supported route or
  rendering paths but are not default buttons.
- `source_adaptation_review` opens a three-step work modal for source or brief
  input, writing-direction confirmation, and draft review. The sidebar retains
  only the entry and current request-scoped status; source/runtime diagnostics
  remain collapsed in the modal.
- Returned artifacts are `editor_content_support_flow` suggestions. They do not
  assign terms, insert links, import media, publish content, or write SEO fields.
- The selected-block toolbar may trigger `polish_notes` for the current
  selection or paragraph only. It returns clarity, fact-gap, tone, and editing
  direction notes; it does not return replacement copy or update the block.
- `internal_links` returns `internal_link_candidates.v1`: related internal
  targets, suggested anchor text, placement hints, and Site Knowledge evidence
  for manual editor review only.
- `publish_preflight` returns `pre_publish_review.v1` as the unified readiness
  panel, plus duplicate-risk evidence and a `seo_meta_handoff_preview.v1`
  single-post Core proposal payload when a title and description candidate are
  available. The editor can submit it as one pending Core review proposal, but
  Toolbox does not approve, execute, or write SEO fields itself.
- The split metadata intents return the same
  `article_discoverability_optimization.v1` section shape through faster
  draft/taxonomy paths. The full `summary_terms_optimization` intent still
  returns hosted AI summary candidates, existing category/tag candidates,
  related Site Knowledge, web search evidence from the discoverability brief,
  ranking and dedupe guidance, review metrics, input scope, proposed new-term
  review notes, preview-only Core handoff guidance, a `content_metadata_delta`
  P0 artifact, and review notes. Existing WordPress terms are preferred;
  proposed new tags remain Core policy-gated strong-review vocabulary-gap
  candidates only. Related Site Knowledge terms
  from current local WordPress posts can boost existing category/tag candidates
  as ranking evidence only; they do not create taxonomy terms, assign terms,
  write excerpts, persist feedback, or own index lifecycle state. The delta artifact records an
  issue record, diagnosis, excerpt/category/tag delta, authorization
  classification, outcome checks, and learning candidates without persisting
  learning or audit truth. Its handoff packet labels proposal-ready actions for
  Generate and apply summary, Recommend and apply tags, Recommend categories,
  and Create new tags and assign; Core policy owns any auto-approval decision.
  It does not update excerpts, assign terms, create terms, mutate SEO fields,
  index content, own taxonomy governance, store acceptance/audit truth, or own a
  RAG lifecycle.

For content-support AI callers, the canonical composition sequence is:

1. `npcink-toolbox/build-content-discoverability-brief`
2. `npcink-toolbox/search-site-knowledge`
3. `npcink-toolbox/search-image-source`
4. `npcink-abilities-toolkit/build-image-candidate-adoption-plan` after operator
   review
5. `/flows/media-brief` only as a compatibility REST route for saved-post
   media planning.
6. `npcink-toolbox/build-ai-article-writing-pack` only as a broad
   writing-support fallback
7. `npcink-toolbox/build-article-write-plan` only after a reviewed human
   draft exists

The sequence is a recommendation for composing tool inputs, not a workflow
runtime contract. Toolbox does not schedule, retry, index, import media, publish
posts, write article bodies, or mutate SEO fields.

Stable first-version scopes:

- `cap.toolbox.image_source`
- `cap.toolbox.vector_search`
- `cap.toolbox.knowledge.search`
- `cap.toolbox.knowledge.read`
- `cap.toolbox.knowledge.sync`
- `cap.toolbox.workflow_suggest`
- `cap.toolbox.context.read`

Content context consumers should call
`npcink-toolbox/validate-content-discoverability-context` before using the
context for third-party AI workflows. For one post or topic, call
`npcink-toolbox/build-content-discoverability-brief` to get the
suggestion-only SEO/AEO/GEO instruction pack, proposal template, conservative
candidate values, and Core handoff reminders.

Do not rename these scopes unless Npcink Governance Core explicitly changes the app-key
scope contract.

## Ability Registration Lifecycle

Do not call `register_with_npcink_abilities_toolkit()` synchronously during plugin
hook setup. That triggers translation too early on modern WordPress.

Current lifecycle:

- helper registration is deferred to `wp_abilities_api_categories_init` with
  priority `1`;
- native category registration skips if helper registration already succeeded;
- native category registration also checks `wp_has_ability_category()` before
  registering `npcink-toolbox`;
- native ability registration skips when helper registration already succeeded.

This prevents early textdomain notices and duplicate Toolbox category notices.

## Admin Surface

Preferred menu:

- `Npcink -> Workflow Toolbox`
- `admin.php?page=npcink-toolbox`

When no shared Npcink parent menu exists:

- `Tools -> Npcink Workflow Toolbox`
- `tools.php?page=npcink-toolbox`

Submenu position is `45`, after Abilities and before Cloud Addon.

Toolbox may reuse Content Assistant's product-surface discipline, but only as a
UI and contract pattern. The default result surface should show summary,
candidates, governed handoff, and then collapsed details. Do not import Content
Assistant article/comment/media lanes, local write flows, or runtime ownership
into Toolbox.

## Local Smoke Environment

Verified local site path:

```bash
/Users/muze/Local Sites/npcink/app/public
```

Verified plugin symlink:

```bash
/Users/muze/Local Sites/npcink/app/public/wp-content/plugins/npcink-workflow-toolbox -> /Users/muze/gitee/npcink-workflow-toolbox
```

Global WP-CLI is installed on this workstation and should be preferred for
WordPress plugin development, smoke tests, Plugin Check, activation, and status
checks. Confirm it before use:

```bash
command -v wp
wp --info
```

The verified current global binary is:

```bash
/opt/homebrew/bin/wp
```

Always set `WP_PATH` or pass `--path`; do not assume the current repository is
the WordPress root. For the local Toolbox site:

```bash
WP_PATH="/Users/muze/Local Sites/npcink/app/public"
```

Do not write local admin passwords into repository files.

Useful smoke commands:

```bash
wp --path="$WP_PATH" plugin activate npcink-workflow-toolbox

wp --path="$WP_PATH" plugin status npcink-workflow-toolbox

wp --path="$WP_PATH" eval 'wp_set_current_user( 1 ); do_action( "rest_api_init" ); $request = new WP_REST_Request( "GET", "/npcink-toolbox/v1/status" ); $response = rest_do_request( $request ); echo "status=" . $response->get_status() . "\n";'
```

If a Local.app site has `DB_HOST=localhost` and WP-CLI cannot connect to the
database, find the active Local MySQL socket and inject it through
`WP_CLI_MYSQL_SOCKET`:

```bash
find "$HOME/Library/Application Support/Local/run" -path '*/mysql/mysqld.sock' -print

WP_CLI_MYSQL_SOCKET="/path/to/Local/run/site-id/mysql/mysqld.sock"
php -d mysqli.default_socket="$WP_CLI_MYSQL_SOCKET" \
    -d pdo_mysql.default_socket="$WP_CLI_MYSQL_SOCKET" \
    "$(command -v wp)" --path="$WP_PATH" plugin status npcink-workflow-toolbox
```

If the global `wp` becomes unavailable, the fallback is a temporary WP-CLI phar
plus Local PHP and the active Local MySQL socket:

```bash
WP_CLI=/tmp/wp-cli.phar
WP_CLI_PHP="/Users/muze/Library/Application Support/Local/lightning-services/php-8.0.30+0/bin/darwin-arm64/bin/php"
WP_CLI_MYSQL_SOCKET="/Users/muze/Library/Application Support/Local/run/NPb24Zg9g/mysql/mysqld.sock"
WP_PATH="/Users/muze/Local Sites/npcink/app/public"
```

Adapter and Abilities smoke commands can use the same variables:

```bash
cd /Users/muze/gitee/npcink-abilities-toolkit
WP_CLI=/tmp/wp-cli.phar WP_CLI_PHP="$WP_CLI_PHP" WP_CLI_ERROR_REPORTING=8191 WP_CLI_MYSQL_SOCKET="$WP_CLI_MYSQL_SOCKET" WP_PATH="$WP_PATH" composer smoke:wp

cd /Users/muze/gitee/npcink-openclaw-adapter
WP_CLI=/tmp/wp-cli.phar WP_CLI_PHP="$WP_CLI_PHP" WP_CLI_ERROR_REPORTING=8191 WP_CLI_MYSQL_SOCKET="$WP_CLI_MYSQL_SOCKET" WP_PATH="$WP_PATH" composer smoke:wp
```

Do not manually re-fire `wp_abilities_api_categories_init` and
`wp_abilities_api_init` after WordPress has already loaded all active plugins;
that can produce duplicate notices from other active plugins unrelated to
Toolbox.

## REST Route Matrix

The first-version route matrix is exact:

- `GET /status`
- `POST /image-candidates`
- `POST /vector-search`
- `POST /knowledge-search`
- `POST /web-search/test`
- `POST /web-search/diagnostics`
- `POST /site-knowledge/search`
- `POST /site-knowledge/sync`
- `GET /site-knowledge/status`
- `POST /agent-feedback`
- `POST /agent-feedback/summary`
- `POST /ai/content-support`
- `POST /ai/site-helpers`
- `POST /ai/image-generation`
- `POST /flows/article-brief`
- `POST /flows/article-assistant`
- `POST /flows/article-plan`
- `POST /flows/image-candidate-adoption-plan`
- `POST /local-admin-consent/featured-image`
- `POST /strong-local-confirmation/image-adoption`
- `POST /flows/site-knowledge-review-plan`
- `POST /flows/nightly-inspection-review-plan`
- `POST /flows/content-metadata-apply-plan`
- `POST /flows/media-alt-caption-review-plan`
- `POST /flows/media-brief`
- `POST /editor/content-support`
- `POST /media-derivative-handoff`
- `GET /nightly-inspection/cloud-runtime-entitlement`
- `POST /nightly-inspection/cloud-batch`
- `GET /nightly-inspection/cloud-batch/recent`
- `GET /nightly-inspection/cloud-batch/{run_id}`
- `GET|POST /nightly-inspection/cloud-batch/{run_id}/result`
- `POST /nightly-inspection/cloud-batch/{run_id}/retry`

Do not add routes for publish, delivery, workflow-run consoles, queues,
schedulers, approval stores, write confirmation, featured-image mutation, media
upload/import, SEO mutation, indexing, or re-indexing without a new boundary
decision.

Nightly Inspection recent and retry routes are bounded Cloud detail bridges.
They do not create a server-side Toolbox run history, local queue, retry
processor, Core proposal, or WordPress write.

## Verification Gates

Default Toolbox gates:

```bash
composer test:all
composer validate --no-check-publish
git diff --check
```

`composer.json` intentionally omits a Composer `version` field. The plugin
version belongs in the plugin header and `readme.txt`.
